      <b>Title:</b> AI needs ethics, but we need to change the game.<br><br>
      <b>Abstract:</b> The recent hype of AI and its apparently unavoidable permeation of all areas of life has gone hand in hand with calls for establishing regulatory measures to enforce ethical use. Given the present and foreseen threats of unregulated use of AI, it is clear that guardrails, international agreements, and policies to protect the rights and interests of citizens are needed. However, the ongoing power shift away from publicly funded AI research towards industrial R&D could effectively result in self-regulation of industry rather than transparency of systems and accountability. Academic research not tied to commercial interests therefore needs to play a much stronger role in this process. In the talk, I will argue that academia for this reason also needs to define clear and stronger policies for research and industry cooperations and needs to invest considerable resources to keep their level of expertise and believably act in the public interest. Furthermore, universities need to take their mission seriously by properly valuing ethical research over amplifying the industry&#96;s agenda.<br><br>
